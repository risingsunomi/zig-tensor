# Zig-Tensor
A tensor library for zig

## Dev/Focus
Current focus is to create a tensor, and math for tensors, library that can be used in machine learning and inferencing applications. This library is focused on models based on tensors (image models, large language models, etc). Currently we are focusing on creating an LLM chat as our demo but will create examples and documentation. We hope to expand to other methods non-tensor based modeling and add this to a suite.
